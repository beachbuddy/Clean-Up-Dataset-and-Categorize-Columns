# Clean-Up-Dataset-and-Categorize-Columns

In this milestone you will clean up the anomalies of the input dataset, including dealing with missing values and invalid values, so that the dataset is ready to train a deep learning model. You need to deal with missing values because the deep learning model can only be trained on numeric data. Model training will fail if there are missing values in the training dataset.
In addition to tackling missing values, you also want to deal with invalid values (that is, values that don’t make sense in their columns, such as negative prices or values in the neighborhood group column that aren’t one of the 5 boroughs of New York). Training your model with values that aren’t reflecting the real-world use case can lead to reduced model performance. When you have completed this milestone, you will have a cleaned-up dataset that will be ready for you to train the deep learning model in the next liveProject in this series, part 2: Training the model.
